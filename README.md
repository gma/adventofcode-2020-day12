# The "Rain Risk" Coding Problem

This is the result of my test-driven attempt at the problem set on the [12th day] of Advent of Code in 2020. I shan't try and explain it here; for context you'll want to [read the AoC explanation][12th day].

I did it while watching [Joe work through the problem] during PyData Manchester's monthly meetup (August 2021).

## Usage

To run the tests:

    python test_rainrisk.py

To run the code itself, on an input file containing one instruction per line:

    python rainrisk.py <filename>
